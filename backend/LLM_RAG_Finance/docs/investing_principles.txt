Investing Principles (General, educational)

- Diversification reduces idiosyncratic risk (e.g., broad index funds)
- Consider time horizon: longer horizons typically tolerate more volatility
- Risk and return are related; higher expected returns usually involve higher risk
- Fees matter: expense ratios and transaction costs reduce net returns
- Asset allocation should align with risk tolerance and goals
- Rebalance periodically to maintain target allocation
- Past performance does not guarantee future results
