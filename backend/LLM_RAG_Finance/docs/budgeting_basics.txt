Budgeting Basics (US)

50/30/20 rule (example guideline):
- 50% Needs (rent, utilities, groceries, minimum debt payments)
- 30% Wants (dining out, entertainment)
- 20% Savings/Debt payoff (emergency fund, investments, extra debt payments)

Emergency fund:
- Typical target: 3–6 months of essential expenses
- Keep liquid (high-yield savings)

Debt strategies:
- Avalanche (highest interest first)
- Snowball (smallest balance first)

Rule of thumb:
- Keep housing costs ~25–30% of gross income
- Track spending monthly; adjust categories as needed
